Our valiant hero, the mediator implementation, is armed with custom error classes that gallantly handle exceptions, protecting your application from the turmoil and pandemonium that could result from unforeseen circumstances. Let's embark on an enchanting journey through these custom error classes and see how they help maintain serenity in your application.

- ArgumentException: This whimsical little fellow is a custom error class that extends the standard Error class. It is designed to tackle situations where an argument to a function or method is invalid. When ArgumentException is called upon, it leaps into action, dutifully carrying a message that describes the nature of the error and, if provided, the name of the faulty parameter. With its mighty power, it brings clarity to the situation, helping developers understand the cause of the issue and make necessary adjustments.

- ArgumentNullException: A loyal companion to ArgumentException, the ArgumentNullException error class is specialized to address cases where a value is unexpectedly null or undefined. Extending ArgumentException, this trusty protector ensures that developers are informed when an argument is missing or not provided. It valiantly carries the message: "Unhandled Exception: ArgumentNullException: Value cannot be null." With the optional parameter name, it brings enlightenment to the developers, guiding them towards the source of the problem.

With these two noble warriors by your side, your application is shielded from the chaos that may arise from unexpected errors. They stand guard, providing clear and insightful information to developers, allowing them to quickly address issues and maintain the tranquility and harmony of the Tiny MediatR kingdom.
